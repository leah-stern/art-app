## Description
This is an educational web app that teaches the user about works of art that I have personally researched. I have a double major in both Computer Science and Art History, so I wanted to create a project that allows me to engage with both fields. This app was built using Flask and is hosted by Heroku. I also used gunicorn in order to run the app from Heroku.

## NOTE
This app is a work in progress. In the future, I hope to add many more works and fix the styling to be a lot cleaner and more intuitive.
